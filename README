The Clock
---------

How To Play:
1. Open Index.html
2. Play

Instructions:
Up/w - Increment by 5 minutes
Down/s - Decrement by 5 minutes
Spacebar - Stop/start time (How time works: Every second of earth time = a minute of game time)
Drag hands - Change time

Notes:
- This was my first project using CreateJS and Canvas.
- As such, alot of createjs calls are probably pulled right out of the tuts so I hope I've 
  demonstrated enthusiasm and ability to learn if not mastery of the framework or correct createjs patterns.
- Most fun tech test I've ever taken! Reminds me of 3D matrix transforms in adv graphics where you can chain transforms for different perspectives.
- Look, no Globals! Ok.. there are two, Clock and DigitalClock
- This is a 12 hour clock, but it is forgiving about invalid values and tries to accomodate by using modulous.

Credits:
- Wife: Helped me figure out 'tanToRotation', is this cheating? Got stuck on it...



Enjoy!
